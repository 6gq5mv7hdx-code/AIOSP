Atomic Interferometry Open Standard Project

Welcome!
Welcome to the Atom Interferometer Open Standard Project! This is a community-driven initiative aimed at making atom interferometry more accessible, affordable, and standardized for researchers and communities around the world.

Our Mission
Our goal is to create an open-source framework that allows scientists, engineers, and enthusiasts to collaborate on building cost-effective and standardized atom interferometers. By sharing designs, best practices, and innovations, we hope to lower the barriers to entry and make this technology more widely available.

How to Get Involved
	•	Contribute Designs: Share your own atom interferometer designs, schematics, and ideas for cost reduction.
	•	Develop Standards: Help us create a set of open standards for building and using these devices, so they can be replicated easily.
	•	Collaborate Globally: Join discussions, propose experiments, and connect with others who are passionate about making precision measurement technology more accessible.

Join Us
We’d love to have you on board! Whether you’re an experienced physicist or just curious about the field, there’s a place for you in this project. Let’s work together to build a global network of open, affordable atom interferometers.
